
Several months ago, a few angst-list members were mulling over the idea of
AngstCon III, where to have it, and when.  It became quickly apparent that if
we held it in Minneapolis, then the turnout would be pretty good, since five
of the members live in that area.  So a few arrangements were made, the date
debated wildly, and eventually the weekend of March 27th was decided upon.
